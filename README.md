# minesweeperGUI

This is a GUI version of minesweeper created during my sophomore year; I have imporved it in the last few weeks. There are still a few bugs that need to be ironed out but I am moving on from this project for now. I have tried to make it as close to the original in terms of the userinterface. Below is a clip of the application in action. There is also an excutable that can be download to play on Windows computers. I hope you like and feel free to clone the project.
